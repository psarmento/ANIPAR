# ANIPAR
Spectral synthesis code to generate atmospheric parameters for FGKM stars from their NIR spectra - for instructions and reference please check paper "Determination of spectroscopic parameters for 313 M dwarf stars from their APOGEE Data Release 16 H-band spectra" by Pedro Sarmento, BÃ¡rbara Rojas-Ayala, Elisa Delgado Mena, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04848; AA/2020/39703)

Code created for python3 + iSpec_v20201001 (available from https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/manual/introduction)

A manual for the usage of the code is included in this folder
